react-test-3
============

Run:

    ./bash.bash create

Success! Created test-3 at ~\GitHub\react-test-3\test-3
Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

    npm start       # Starts the development server.
    npm run build   # Bundles the app into static files for production.
    npm test        # Starts the test runner.
    npm run eject   # Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

    cd test-3
    npm start

_Happy hacking!_
